IMPORTANT if you have ussies with  not reading from input file or not writing to output file  Update Node to Currrent version 16.13.because here used Custom Read and Write strems

To run app write in console   node i  

Some example how to run app  ---------  node i  -c "C1-R1-C0-C0-A-R0-R1-R1-A-C1" -i "./input.txt" -o "./output.txt".
Or you cat use it without scopes    node i  -c  C1-R1-C0-C0-A-R0-R1-R1-A-C1  -i ./input.txt  -o  ./output.txt

If output and input path not provided  app  uses console  for read and for write

If input or output path provided but not exists  process stops working as required in task   with explanations that is wrong

There is 3 Transform strems placed ./Cipers/*  ---on bottom of each ciperFILE   as required in task

All other requirements done check list ---https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/basic-nodejs-course/blob/master/cross-check/ciphering-cli-tool.md





All tasks done  
Max score: 190
